# Magic Piano for Improvisation


## Introduction

Aiming to bring jazz improvisation experience more accessible to the general public, the Magic Piano is a web-based virtual instrument that simplifies the scale change process by dynamically mapping a key press to a note in a predetermined sequence of scales.

Instead of worrying about playing a â€œwrong" note, the user can focus on the other aspects of jazz improvisation such as phrasing, rhythm, and motif development.

## Usage
Open in Chrome:

- Press number keys to play the piano.

- There are three selectable song presets with chord and scale changes.

The audio for the accompaniments are exported from iReal Pro (a jazz improvisation practice app).
