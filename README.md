# Magic Piano for Improvisation


## Introduction

Aiming to bring jazz improvisation experience more accessible to the general public, the Magic Piano is a virtual instrument that simplifies the scale change process by dynamically mapping a key press to a note in a predetermined sequence of scales.

Instead of worrying about playing a â€œwrong" note, the user can focus on the other aspects of jazz improvisation such as rhythm and patterns.
